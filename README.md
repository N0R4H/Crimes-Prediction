<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This was Preparatory Classes (PREPA) evaluation test on personal initiative work (TIPE), My work was focused on Crime Forecasting using time series analysis with the Kaggle's Crimes in Chicago dataset. Utilizing techniques like ARIMA, I developed a map delineating areas of high and low crime risk, providing insights into safer and more dangerous locations.

## About DatasetThe dataset comprises reported crime incidents in Chicago from 2001 to present, excluding the most recent week, sourced from the Chicago Police Department's CLEAR system. To protect victim privacy, addresses are only provided at the block level, and specific locations are withheld. Users are cautioned that the data might be subject to change due to ongoing investigations or errors, and its accuracy over time is not guaranteed, as stated by the Chicago Police Department.
